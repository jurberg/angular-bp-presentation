# AngularJS Best Practices Presentation

Best practices for AngularJS collected from around the web (plus a few of my own too!).  This presentation
was given at a few events around the Twin Cities in Spring 2015.

Here's a [link to the presentation](https://rawgit.com/jurberg/angular-bp-presentation/master/presentation/index.html).
